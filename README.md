# Dendriform | Recursion Visualizer
By Deborah Wei 

## Background 

Recursion is always a field that is difficult for people to visualize, especially myself. Something that always helped me understand recursion was through looking at each recursive call drawn out. My project will be a recursion visualizer which illustrates each branch that is created when the recursive function calls itself. There will be demo recursive functions such as Fibonacci, factorials, DFS, and binary search (subject to change). My tree will be interactive so you can click on nodes and it will collapse them or extend them. There will be different colors symbolizing the stage the recursive call is at: called, processing, or returned. 

## Functionality and MVPs
User functionality: Click on tree node and it will collapse or open up. They can input the values they want the recursive function to use. 
Tree nodes: Have different colors based on if that recursive call is still processing, returning, or has not been reached yet. 

## Wireframes

![Alt text](relative/path/to/assets/images/wireframe.png)

**Nav links**: where I will attach my GitHub, LinkedIn, etc. 

**Main screen**: will contain the tree nodes and possible the call stack 

**Dropdown of functions**: this will allow the users to choose different functions to visualize 

**Input**: will possibly contain a place for the user to input the values or possibly, their own function 

**Title**: Dendriform which means tree shaped

## Technology, Libraries, and APIs
D3 (animations and interactions) 

## Implementation Timeline 

*Thursday afternoon* (7/21): Create roadmap and filepath of what files I want to create and what functionality each folder contains (similar to the chess roadmap we were given) 

*Friday* (7/22): Read on documentation of libraries

*Saturday* (7/23): Figure out recursion visualization logic

*Sunday* (7/24): Figure out recursion visualization logic (part 2) 

*Monday* (7/25): Create buttons and inputs 

*Tuesday* (7/26): CSS (part 1) 

*Wednesday* (7/27): CSS (part 2)

*Thursday morning* (7/28): Put up on Github and write a READ.me file


## Bonus 
 
If there is enough time, I would also like to add an input option for the user to add their own recursive functions to visualize. Additionally, adding a call stack visualizer to illustrate what the recursive calls would look like in the terminal. Maybe for visualization purposes, there will be a dark mode that could be set by the user through a toggle button.
